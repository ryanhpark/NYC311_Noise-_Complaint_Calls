# Socio-Economic Diversity And Its Relationship With Neighborhood Conflict In NYC

## Abstract
Neighborhood dynamics have been largely examined with conflict that exists among neighbors. While past research has mainly focused on ethno-racial diversity and its negative effect on neighborhood conflict, this paper addresses the complex relationship between socio-economic diversity and neighborhood conflict in New York City. This paper used 311 data which consist of noise complaint calls made to real-time government service request hotline and Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) level 5-year estimates census data combined by a spatial software package, QGIS. By scrutinizing the empirical evidence of neighborhood conflict in New York City with a negative binomial fixed effects regression model, it shows that all else being equal, there are more noise complaint calls contacted through 311 in neighborhoods where the level of socio-economic diversity is higher. Similarly, the analytic approach with the tertile Gini index indicates that there are more noise complaint calls made in neighborhoods with a high Gini index and fewer calls in neighborhoods with a low Gini index, compared to neighborhoods with medium Gini index.
